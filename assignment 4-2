//Write a program that will calculate and display the total surface area and volume of a can 
(i.e., a right circular cylinder).  The program should prompt for and read the can's top radius and height in main
and then call a function, calc.  This function will receive via arguments the can's top radius and height 
and will perform the required surface area and volume calculations. 
The surface area and volume values should be “returned” to main via reference parameters. 
Then, main should display the can’s surface area and volume. Use a global constant for the value of pi = 3.14159. 
Note: The function calc should not contain any cout or cin statements. 
Formulas:  volume = pi(r^2)h , A = 2pi(r^2) + 2prh
Here is an example of what output should look like from running your program (user input is shown in bold):
Enter can radius (inches): 3.5
Enter can height (inches): 6.5
Can surface area = 219.911 square inches
Can volume = 250.149 cubic inches

    cout << "Can volume = "<< volume << " cubic inches" <<endl;
  
    return 0;
}

void calc (double radius, double height, double& volume, double& area)
{
    volume = pi * pow(radius,2) * height;
    area = (2*pi*pow(radius,2)) + (2*pi*radius*height);
